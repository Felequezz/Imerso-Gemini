**What's this all about?**

This project is a cool text-based roleplay game server called Chaos's Chronics! It's designed for action-adventure enthusiasts who enjoy weaving tales through text commands. 

**How does it work?**

The Discord platform serves as the game's hub, where players can interact and embark on their roleplaying journeys. The provided HTML code structures the visual elements of the server's information page, while JavaScript adds a search functionality to make it easier for players to find what they're looking for.

**What's under the hood?**

Here's a breakdown of the technologies used to build this project:

- **HTML:** Provides the foundation for the web page's structure and content.
- **CSS:** Styles the page's layout, making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript:** Brings interactivity to the search function, allowing users to find specific information.

**Getting involved**
